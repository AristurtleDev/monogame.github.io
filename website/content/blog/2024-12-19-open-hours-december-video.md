Thanks to everyone who joined us for our 3rd "Open Hours" AMA session.

## Video of our 3rd "Open Hours" AMA Meeting

For those who missed our 3rd "Open Hours" AMA yesterday, the recording is now available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYrQlHRv2C0), so you can find out what we've been up to and what we're working on, as well as what questions from the community we replied to.

## The Meeting Schedule

If you didn't make it this month, all is not lost. Each month, one week on from the MonoGame Foundation monthly board meeting, the group has agreed to host a series of sessions to both communicate announcements to the community and also open the floor up to questions the community has about MonoGame operations or ask questions that they have about the framework.

* MonoGame Board meetings - 2nd Wednesday each month
* "MonoGame "Open Hours" - 3rd Wednesday each month - 4PM UTC
